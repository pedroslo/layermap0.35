# Layer map for Cadence Innovus Stream out (𝐴𝑀𝑆 0.35 𝜇𝑚)
The tricky part about exporting the design and doing the GDSII file extraction is using the correct layer map file. For correctly exporting the desing, the layer map file is important to make the layers exported from Innovus to be correctly read and interpreted by Virtuoso.

This repository contains a Layer map file, created for 𝐴𝑀𝑆 0.35 𝜇𝑚 that can map a layout from Cadence Innovus to Cadence Virtuso.
